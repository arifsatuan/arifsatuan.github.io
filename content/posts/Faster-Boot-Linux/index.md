### 1. Check speed of loading
Just type on your favourite terminal to get know your 
```bash
systemd-analyze
```
![Tampilan Hugo](fastinitial.png "Initial speed of booting")

As you can see above, full time to booting is `59,301s` with specific below

|no | Term | time (s) | description |
----|------|----------|------------ |
|1. |**Firmware** |  `8,998s`| speed when booting (BIOS) |
|2. |**Loader** |  `9,269s`| loader I don't know |
|3. |**Kernel** |  `17,224s`| time when loading initramfs that compressed  |
|4. |**Userspace** |  `23,810s`| time starting app|

### 2. Know which suspect
Know which the suspect to be _blaming to_ we can type on terminal like below:
```bash
systemd-analyze blame
```
Resulting
```bash
6.681s NetworkManager-wait-online.service
5.051s bolt.service
2.954s systemd-udev-settle.service
1.917s blueman-mechanism.service
1.680s mariadb.service
1.238s networkd-dispatcher.service
 950ms udisks2.service
 948ms apache2.service
 885ms accounts-daemon.service
 749ms ModemManager.service
 683ms dev-sda6.device
 446ms cups.service
 423ms user@1000.service
 407ms ubuntu-system-adjustments.service
 402ms gdm.service
 378ms power-profiles-daemon.service
 370ms polkit.service
 364ms avahi-daemon.service
 363ms bluetooth.service
```
Look above, `NetworkManager-wait-online.service` took 6,6s then `bolt.service` took 5s. It may vary depend on your system. 

### 3. Reduce it!
To reduce this to boot on initial, can just **mask** using `systemctl`
```bash
sudo systemctl mask NetworkManager-wait-online.service
sudo systemctl mask bolt.service
etc . . .
```
### 4. Change compression
By changing the compression algorithm, we can save some time as some algorithms are faster to decompress the data. Iâ€™ve found that lz4 is the fastest for my case. It may vary for your CPU. The image is 6.6MB now, but it decompresses a lot faster.
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf

MODULES=dep
COMPRESS=lz4

$ sudo update-initramfs -u
```
### 5. Check Result
After two treatments above, we can repeat `systemd-analyze` again.

Horay!!! That is great improvement. From total `59 s` to `26 s`
